# WoW Blender Studio

- Supported Blender version : 3.4
- Supported WoW versions : 3.3.5 and 7.3(not stable)
- M2 exporting doesn't work for animated models and is also unstable for static models. (Beta build for animated M2 available in discord)
- The addon needs to be built by running build.py with a python version matching blender's, or grab a pre compiled build at https://gitlab.com/skarnproject/blender-wow-studio/-/jobs
- To enable the addon, search "WoW" in the addons list, fill the WoW Client path, WMV log path (select log.txt), cache and project paths (use empty folders)
- Discord : https://discord.gg/SBEDRXrSnd
